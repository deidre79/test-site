      <p>Located on Japan's southern island of Kyushu, Saga Prefecture borders Fukuoka, Nagasaki, and the Sea of Japan. Saga is not particularly well-known among foreign tourists and even within Japan it's known as a mostly rural prefecture. However, it's known as a birthplace of ceramics, as well as for sites like <a href="https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/762/">Karatsu Castle</a>, <a href="https://www.yutokusan.jp/en/">Yutoku Inari Shrine</a>, the <a href="https://www.yoshinogari.jp/en/">Yoshinogari Historical Park</a>, and <a href="https://www.mifuneyamarakuen.jp/en/">Mifuneyama Rakuen</a>.</p>

        <p>The largest cities in Saga Prefecture by population (from 2020) are:
            <ol>
                <li>Saga (233,466)</li>
                <li>Karatsu (117,431)</li>

        </p>
        <p>Interestingly, although Saga is one of the least populated prefectures in Japan — ranked 42 out of 47 — it actually is one of the top prefectures ranked by area in kilometers.</p>
